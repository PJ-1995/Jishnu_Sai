    <h2>My Research Interests</h2>
    <p>
        My research interests encompass a broad range of topics in theoretical physics, with a primary focus on early universe cosmology and the quantum aspects of gravity and gauge fields.
        I am particularly motivated by the interplay between theoretical models and cosmological observations, striving to bridge these domains effectively.
        But, I am generally interested in exploring any topic in physics that catches my curiosity when I have the time and mood!
      </p>
      <p>
        My doctoral research is dedicated to investigating the non-Gaussian features of primordial fluctuations.
        Specifically, I utilize various non-Gaussian correlators to explore the correlation between inflationary perturbations and primordial magnetic fields during the inflationary epoch.
        This work aims to constrain and distinguish between different models of inflation and inflationary magnetogenesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also interested in the interplay between theoretical predictions and observational data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure surveys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Current projects include investigating inflationary magnetogenesis and using higher-order correlators to distinguish different inflationary scenarios.
