        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a final-year Ph.D. student at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, under the guidance of Prof. Rajeev Kumar Jain. My research interests encompass a broad range of topics in theoretical physics, with a primary focus on early universe cosmology and the quantum aspects of gravity and gauge fields. I am particularly motivated by the interplay between theoretical models and cosmological observations, striving to bridge these domains effectively.
        
My doctoral research is dedicated to investigating the non-Gaussian features of primordial fluctuations. Specifically, I utilize various non-Gaussian correlators to explore the correlation between inflationary perturbations and primordial magnetic fields during the inflationary epoch. This work aims to constrain and distinguish between different models of inflation and inflationary magnetogenesis. Building on this foundation, I have recently developed a strong interest in the theoretical aspects of cosmological correlators, including cosmological bootstrap and cosmological collider physics. I aim to continue my research on these topics as a natural progression of my doctoral studies.
